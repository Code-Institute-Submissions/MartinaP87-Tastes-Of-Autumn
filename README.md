# TASTES OF AUTUMN

[View the live project here](https://martinap87.github.io/Tastes-Of-Autumn)

Tastes Of Autumn is an informative website about a food festival taking place in the forest park of Vallombrosa, close to Florence, Tuscany, Italy.  
The festival centers around seasonal food made with organic and autochthonous products. It aims to keep alive traditional dishes that are disappearing from our tables, support the local community and strengthen the sense of community. It also aims to help reduce social isolation in the elderly by involving them in some of the activities and finally raise environmental awareness. It tries to achieve this by talking about the history of this land with the help of the narration of folkloric tales.
The website's purpose is to attract people to the event.
The informal tones used in Tastes Of Autumn are designed to amuse the users and give a sense of a laid-back environment, making them picture the event as fun, relaxed but still culturally enriching. 
The website targets families of the surrounding areas looking for outdoor activities; people interested in food, nature, and history; and tourists that are looking for a deeper understanding of the popular culture and to be able to be immersed in it. 
The site hopes to give a detailed idea of what the event is about and at the same time stimulate users' curiosity.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML 

No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmartinap87.github.io%2FTastes-Of-Autumn%2F)

- CSS 

No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmartinap87.github.io%2FTastes-Of-Autumn%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) 

 ## **Bugs:**

 Sometimes, when opening the website on the browser, the footer background image and the main image on the sign-up page wouldn’t load properly. 
- I then tried reducing the size through a compression tool and changed the format from jpg to webp. 
- The drastic size reduction corrected the issue and bettered the performance of the page. 

## **Deployment:** 

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab;
- On the menu on the left, under Code and Automation, click on Pages;
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch;
- Once the main branch has been selected, click on Save;
- At the top of the page will then appear the message “Your site is ready to be published at” and the URL;
- Refresh the page and the message will change to  “Your site is published at” and the active URL.
